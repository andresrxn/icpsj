<Text tv='lg'>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</Text>

<Text tv='lg'>Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</Text>

<Text tv='lg'>Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them”; and it was so.</Text>

<Text tv='lg'>And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; He made the stars also. God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</Text>

<Text tv='lg'>Then God said, “Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.” God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</Text>

The earth sprouted vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them after their kind; and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</Text>

<Text tv='lg'>Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so.
